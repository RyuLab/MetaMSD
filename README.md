MetaMSD: Meta analysis for Mass Spectrometry Data
MetaMSD integrates quantitative proteomic results from multiple experiments.

This repository contains a MetaMSD manual, a MetaMSD Rscript (in MetaMSD folder), and example datasets (in Data folder).
The Data folder contains the followings:
1. Two thousands simulated datasets and example simulation R code,
2. Kidney Transplant proteomic data including preprocess details, MetaMSD input files, protein quantification information, 
   and an example R script that converts MSstats outputs to MetaMSD inputs, and 
3. Breast Cancer proteomic data including preprocess details, MetaMSD input files, and protein quantification data.
